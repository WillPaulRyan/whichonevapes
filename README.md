# [Which One Vapes?](http://www.whichonevapes.party)

Which One Vapes? is a webapp that allows users to compare two celebrities and decide who they believe is more likely to "rip fat vape clouds". It includes an Elo rating system to determine the fan-favorite most-likely and least-likely vapers. It is made purely for fun, with no intention to offend any of the celebrities mentioned.

## Technologies

Which One Vapes? and its API are created with:

* The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js)

and is deployed for free on [Heroku](heroku.com).

## Inspiration

Which One Vapes? was originally proposed by [the McElroy brothers](https://www.themcelroy.family/) in episode 321 of their podcast [My Brother, My Brother and Me](https://maximumfun.org/episodes/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-321-which-one-vapes/).

Fellow MBMBAM fan [Aubron Wood](https://aubronwood.com/) made his own version of this website in 2016, which was featured on [Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/which-one-vapes/), but it has has since been removed.
